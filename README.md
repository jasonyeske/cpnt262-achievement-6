### Challenges I encountered

- v-for is still so confusing to me
    - [v-for list rendering](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html#v-for)
    - Using this site I figured it out, but it seems like a lot of extra work
        - Could I not just use normal html li and ul tags?
    - "The v-for directive requires a special syntax in the form of item in items"

- I also had an issue with slots
    - I don't fully understand how it works
    - If I put a slot in my component and then call it on the app, isnt it going to call the whole component anyway?
